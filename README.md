Sample REST (REpresentational State Transfer) webservice 

In this example I'm going to show you how easy it is to create a RESTful web service using Python 2.7 and Flask 0.10.1 microframework.

Let's say we want to write a web service to display List of items/ latops and we want to design a web service for it. The first thing to do is to decide what is the root URL to access this service. 
For example, we could expose this service as:

http://127.0.0.1/latops/

http://127.0.0.1/latops/<id>

You can access this web service via -
*. command line 
*. Browser
*. Curl command - It is recommended to test the web service by using curl command
*. Browser add-in - It is recommended to test the web service by using curl command
